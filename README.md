This is a basic Flask application that displays "Hello World" on the index page.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `bash run.sh` to install Python, initialize a project, and install Flask.
3. Once the installation is complete, run `python app.py` to start the Flask server.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the "Hello World" page.

## Project Structure

* `app.py`: The main entry point for the Flask application.
* `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for rendering "Hello World" using Jinja2 templating.
* `config.py`: The configuration file for the Flask application.
* `requirements.txt`: The dependency list for the project.
* `.gitignore`: A .gitignore file with node-modules and cache files ignored.
* `run.sh`: A bash run script to install Python, initialize a project, and install Flask.

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the `run.sh` script.
